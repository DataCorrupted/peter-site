How long have you been getting drown in seas of screens with different devices and different platforms? 
As programmers, our answer is "on Daily basis." 
Even for ordinary people, what is happening in their home is that they have an Apple, and Windows-based PC and probably Android-driven TV sets. 
Different platforms are making cross-platform work harder and harder. 
For example, how do plan to play a movie on your PC using TV?

Well, now our project Screen++ developed in iLab Hackathon puts all these pain to an end. 
We realized the problem and developed an application that allows screen sharing. 
Besides, we also finished keyboard, mouse and file sharing, allowing you to share files between devices with a simple drag.

We team of 5 developed this using Python and Apache. 
What we are doing now is set up a server, and on each client, we listen to screen and keyboard, exchange this information to other connected devices.

The first demo was developed in 36 hours. 
As a team leader, I participated in the development and commercial plan. 
With the excellent presentation, we won the 3rd prize and 5,000 RMB award :).
