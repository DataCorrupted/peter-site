I had this idea when I came back from CSST@UCLA. 
I realized a hard truth in LA, that I might have a very limited time to see my grandparents if I decide to further my study in States.
By the time I returned from LA, I haven't go home for almost half a year. 
Should I study abort, the duration would be even longer.
So, I decided to visit my grandparents as soon as I landed PVG.  

I paid a visit the day before I left for Shanghai.
I was sharing my experience with my family, telling everyone how to shot a pistol, then me grandpa asked:  

"How many rounds did you shoot?" He was smoking as usual, but looks more thoughtful, as if I reminded him something.   

"50 I suppose."   

"Great, when I was an escort I never had a chance to shot anything."   

"You touched a gun before? Not even misfire?"   

"No! We have to count bullets every time we shift." Now I know what I reminded him of.s

I panicked.
I thought I know my grandpa, I was his favorite child, how come I have no idea he was in the military before?
That's when I found out that, I may know the later part of his life, I had no idea of who he was, what made him him, and why.

I feel terrible for this, not only because I didn't know my grandpa, but also how easy it is to find out everything about a person on the Internet, except him.
Search for someone on the network is easy, they always leave their traces.
You post WeChat posts, Instagram, FaceBook, Twitter, they are all around us.
With every data there, we can construct your personal profile.
What you like, hate. 
Your friends, ex-es, parents, children, pets.
Places you've been to, always wanted to go, currently staying.
Trump better than Hilary, and Xi is an idiot.
All these things, you name it.
We post these out to public, everyone can read them.
That said, I may know more about a hippos 14 timezones away than my grandpa who is really important to my life.

Worried enough? 
You are not even close.
While some of your personal profile is public, some are private to certain companies.
Your cell is collecting your position, giving to whichever app ever asked for it(Of course you granted the access, but you probably never read the dialog and pressed yes); your watch, health.
Banks records every transaction you made, when, where, what.
Google have every mail you wrote.
iTunes know what you listen and Netflix knows what you watch, Pornhub may even know what position you like.
The good news? You die someday, so don't worry about it.
The bad news? Data never die.
Companies pay loads of money for people who have the ability to analysis these data, compress them into datasets, test the models' performance. 

Sometimes this world reminds me of _The Machine_, the cool entity in _Person of Interest_ who oversaw everybody.
The takeaway is, our personal profile is more complete and safer than ever.
Let's assume that we have access to all the data, both public and private, we might be able to reconstruct you.
But this is not the case for my grandpa.
Once he's gone, he's gone. 
No data, no profile, no nothing.

Yet it is easy for Millennials to have their personal profile live on the Internet forever, seniors who don't get to enjoy to benefit are being forgotten, forever. 
I feel my responsibility to make them recorded, stay online, live forever.
(If they agree.)
I was amazed how this idea resembles the one in Westworld.

This is why I started the project and named it after Aeon.
First of all, I like this word.
Somehow it's pronunciation is similar to my name Yuyang.
But I didn't name something just because I like it.
Aeon stands the meaning "a long period", that's what I am hoping for.
I want their identity, personality, profile to stay there forever so that when our child wants to refer to him, he knows where to look.

I plan to do this on senior people.
Unlike bibliography writers, I decide to do interviews and record them.
Let the person that I am interested in explain their life.
Ask the same questions to their children, friends, cross examine their life.
As simple as that.

The person I want to start with is my grandfather.
I would say he is the most difficult one.
Because he passed away about ten years ago.
I cannot ask him personally.
Worse, he is the youngest among his generation, three of his brothers even went earlier, earlier than my birth.
Many of his friends, relatives even passed away before him.
All I can rely on is his wife, two children and two grandchildren(me included).
Glad for him, his was somehow famous in our city 30 years ago, maybe I have access to his living coworkers, friends, too.
Nevertheless, I would miss his first twenty or thirty years of life that no one alive knows.
But I will try.

Wish me good luck. :)
