I had this idea when I came back from CSST@UCLA. 
I realized a hard truth in LA, that I might have a very limited time to see my grandparents if I decide to further my study in States.
By the time I returned from LA, I haven't go home for almost half a year. 
Should I study abort, the duration would be even longer.
So, I decided to visit my grandparents as soon as I landed PVG.  
我在加州大学洛杉矶分校参加CSST时产生了这个想法。
当我在洛杉矶的时候，我意识到这个令人痛心的事实：如果我真的在美帝求学的话，我见到外公外婆的次数可能屈指可数。
我从LA回来的时候我几乎大半年没有回过家，如果我要出国，这个时间只会更长。
所以我一从浦东国际机场降落就决定要去外公家一趟。

I paid a visit the day before I left for Shanghai.
I was sharing my experience with my family, telling everyone how to shot a pistol, then me grandpa asked:  
所以我就在去上海前一天去了外公那里。
当时我正在和加人分享我的经历，顺便告诉他们怎么使用手枪。
然后我外公问：

"How many rounds did you shoot?" He was smoking as usual, but looks more thoughtful, as if I reminded him something.    
“你打了多少发子弹？” 他像往常那样在抽烟，不过看起来很深沉，似乎我让他想起了什么事情。

"50 I suppose."     
“估计50发吧。”

"Great, when I was an escort I never had a chance to shot anything."    
“好哇，我年轻的时候站哨兵，一发都没打过。”

"You touched a gun before? Not even misfire?"   
“你一前当过兵？哪怕连走火都没有吗？”

"No! We have to count bullets every time we shift. Can't miss a thing." Now I know what I reminded him of.
“哪行啊！我们每次换班都要数子弹，一发都不能少。”现在我知道我让他回想起什么了。

I panicked.
I thought I know my grandpa, I was his favorite child, how come I have no idea he was in the military before?
That's when I found out that, I may know the later part of his life, I had no idea of who he was, what made him him, and why.   
不过我慌了。我以为我很了解他，我是他最喜欢的孩子了，怎么会我连他服役过这种事情都不知道呢。
那时候我意识到，也许我很了解他的后半生，关于他是谁，经历过什么，为什么要经历这些，一无所知。

I feel terrible for this, not only because I didn't know my grandpa, but also how easy it is to find out everything about a person on the Internet, except him.
Search for someone on the network is easy, they always leave their traces.
You post WeChat posts, Instagram, FaceBook, Twitter, they are all around us.
With every data there, we can construct your personal profile.
What you like, hate. 
Your friends, ex-es, parents, children, pets.
Places you've been to, always wanted to go, currently staying.
Trump better than Hilary, and Xi is an idiot.
All these things, you name it.
We post these out to public, everyone can read them.
That said, I may know more about a hippos 14 timezones away than my grandpa who is really important to my life.   
我觉得很糟，不仅仅是因为我不够了解外公，更多是因为如果我想了解一个人上网搜一搜很容易，唯独他不行。
上网人肉太容易了，他们总是留下一丝丝痕迹。
你贴微信朋友圈，发Inst， 写脸书， Twitter，你无时不刻不在表达自己。
有了你所有的数据，我们甚至可以重建你的人格。
你的喜、恶。
你的朋友，前女友前男友、父母、孩子，甚至宠物。
我能知道你去过的哪里，想去那些城，现在又身处何方。
你可能觉得特朗普比希拉里好多了，也知道Xi是个傻子。
这些东西，你自己想，无所不及。
我们把这些数据公之于众，人人都能阅读。
正因如此，我对14个时区之外的某个嬉皮士的了解可能都比我的外公多，而外公对我却是如此重要。

Worried enough? 
You are not even close.
While some of your personal profile is public, some are private to certain companies.
Your cell is collecting your position, your watch, health. 
These data are given to whichever app ever asked for it
(Of course you granted the access, but you probably never read the dialog and pressed yes).
Banks records every transaction you made, when, where, what.
Google have every mail you wrote.
iTunes know what you listen and Netflix knows what you watch, Pornhub may even know what position you like.
The good news? You die someday, no one holds anything against you forever, so don't worry about it.
The bad news? Data never die.
Companies pay loads of money for people who have the ability to analysis these data, compress them into datasets, test the recommendation models' reliability. 
你觉得这很可怕吗，这只是冰山一角。
有些你的数据是公开的，有的数据则被各家公司保护起来。
你的手机在记录你的位置信息，手表记录建康。
而任何索取数据的app都能如愿以偿，因为你给了他们权限，不过恐怕你从来没看过是什么权限就点击了确定。
银行记录你的每一笔转账、消费。何时何地何物。
谷歌有你的每一封邮件。
iTunes知道你喜欢什么歌，Netflix了解你的观音偏好，Pornhub甚至知道让你舒适的体位。
好消息是，人终有一死，你不会被人被人揪小辫子。
坏消息，数据是不死的。
各大巨头花重金聘用人才来分析你的这些数据、或者打包成数据集、甚至用来测试推荐模型的可靠性。

Sometimes this world reminds me of _The Machine_, the cool entity in _Person of Interest_ who oversaw everybody.
The takeaway is, our personal profile is more complete and safer than ever.
Let's assume that we have access to all the data, both public and private, we might be able to reconstruct you.
But this is not the case for my grandpa.
Once he's gone, he's gone. 
No data, no profile, no nothing.   
有时候这个世界让我想起“机器”，一个《疑犯追踪》中虚构的有趣实体，他监督一切。
要学到什么经验的话，我们的个人侧写比任何时候都更加完整，安全。
如果假设我们拥有所有数据，公开的或者被公司保密的，我们甚至可以重建你。
但对我的外公而言则不是这样。
一旦他走了，他就永远的离开了。
没有数据，没有侧写，什么都没有。

Yet it is easy for Millennials to have their personal profile live on the Internet forever, seniors who don't get to enjoy to benefit are being forgotten, forever. 
I feel my responsibility to make them recorded, stay online, live forever.
(If they agree.)
I was amazed how this idea resembles the one in Westworld.
在互联网上留下身份侧写，千禧一代轻易实现了“永生”；然而不使用网络的老年人却正在被永久的忘却。
我觉得这是我作为后代的一部分责任，为他们建立档案，把他们上传，获得永生。
（当然如果他们同意的话。）
我甚至惊讶于这个主意和《西部世界》是如此相似。

This is why I started the project and named it after Aeon.
First of all, I like this word.
Somehow it's pronunciation is similar to my name Yuyang.
But I didn't name something just because I like it.
Aeon stands the meaning "a long period", that's what I am hoping for.
I want their identity, personality, profile to stay there forever so that when our child wants to refer to him, he knows where to look.
这就是为何我发起了这个工程而且命名为“亘古计划”。
首先我喜欢这个词。
不知为何他的英文发音和我的名字“宇阳”很像。
然而我并不是因为我的喜好而命名这个计划的，亘古这个词意味着“很长的时间”，这才是我的寓意。
我希望我记录的人们的身份，性格，侧写都能永存。
这样当我们的后代需要了解我们的时候，他知道去哪儿能找到我们。

I even have a naive plan.
Or let's use the word hope.
That these profiles can be used to reconstrct hosts.
Interactive hosts like the ones in _Westworld_.
I don't know how to do it now, but I believe in time.
我甚至有个听起来幼稚的想法，或者说叫希望吧。
我想这些侧写能被用来重建人格。
那种可以交互的人格，就像《西部世界》里那样。
我现在不知道该怎么做，不过我相信时间会给出答案。

I plan to do this on senior people.
They are the ones that are fading fastest.
Unlike bibliography writers, I decide to do interviews and record them.
Let the person that I am interested in explain their life.
Ask the same questions to their children, friends, cross examine their life.
As simple as that.
我想在老年人身上先实施这个计划。
他们正在以不可想象的快速消失在历史长河中。
不像传记作者那样，我决定用对话、录像的方式。
让我要记录的人自己来解释他是谁。
然后去问他的亲朋，交叉对比他们的人生。
就这么简单。

The person I want to start with is my grandfather.
Southern Rong. 
(I took the liberty and translated his name to a word with similar pronunciation.)
I would say he is the most difficult one.
Because he passed away about ten years ago.
I cannot ask him personally.
Worse, he is the youngest among his generation, three of his brothers even went earlier, earlier than my birth.
Many of his friends, relatives even passed away before him.
All I can rely on is his wife, two children and two grandchildren(me included).
Glad for him, his was somehow famous in our city 30 years ago, maybe I have access to his living coworkers, friends, too.
Nevertheless, I would miss his first twenty or thirty years of life that no one alive knows.
But I will try.
我想从我的爷爷开始。
荣绍中。
（我自作主张的把他的英文名翻译成了“南”，英文发音很相近）
我想他是最难的一个，因为他大概十年前就去世了，我没法亲口问他任何问题。
更糟糕的是，他是那一代人里最年轻的一个。
他的三个哥哥早就仙逝了，甚至在我出生之前。
他的很多朋友，亲戚也是这样。
我只能依赖他的妻子，也就是我的奶奶。

Wish me good luck. :)
