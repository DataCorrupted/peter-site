While I was in Los Angeles, I found a song called _Homeward_, composed by Marcus Warner. 
I was in love with [_Homeward_](https://marcuswarnermusic.bandcamp.com/track/homeward) at the first sight. 
It is known that you can concatenate 'back' or 'fore' with 'ward' to show a direction. 
That said, 'homeward' can be interpreted as 'direction home'. 
Almost instantly that reminds me of my home.

But the question is, where is it?

I cannot deny that my home is in China, at least that is what I said whenever front desk in Hedrick Hall wants to verify my home address. 
And for what's worth, I might have to bear with this identity for another decade to get on a flight or simply get drunk. 
Cannot throw it away. But when thinking carefully, that isn't really my identity.

It's not strange that I had a hard time appreciating Chinese culture when the book I read, TV program I watch and even games I play is not from China.
When other kids were reading _Romance of the Three Kingdoms_, my first long novel was actually [_Doomsday Book_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_Book_(novel)) by [Connie Willis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connie_Willis). 
It is a good science fiction which won both [_Nebula Award_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebula_Award) and [_Hugo Award_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_Award), yet until 2016 only 23 novels can won both. 
That's how I know [Larry Niven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Niven), by reading through that 23 novels(Except that I have already finished _Doomsday Book_). 
Larry's work [_Ringworld_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ringworld) was so fascinating that it pulled me away from _Water Margin_, and honestly, I never finish _Water Margin_. 
I felt suck when I was told Song at last surrendered to the government and get killed so after.

We do learn Chinese, History and Politics in Middle school. 
But I was reading _The Summer of 1787, The Men who Made the Constitution_ by then. 
I have to say that the history and politics education in China is such a failure that it can barely brought anyone's interest. 
After all, the story of how the world's great nations constitution is made is way more funny than the importance of the foundation of our party. 
The educators may forget that human beings memorize stories better than bullet points.
Or they just want to brainwash everyone to follow our party's lead. 
Whichever reason it may be, I am lucky that I have passed that painful time(and got a low score on Politics & History).

Maybe that's the reason I have always preferred Uncle Sam over China. 
To me, China, it's society, Government, cities and everything look like a tiring other half. 
You argue, you fight, you struggle(And with a 'democracy' government, I lose every time).
You get tired, you stop fighting and all you want now is to cut loose.
Yet, U.S., is like shiny ones you bump into in street.

I suppose that is what I wanted to find in LA except for 5 recommendation letters.
To tell if the pretty Uncle is what it looks like. 
And, as you would expect, it is not.

Freedom is not about vote, it's about believing.
Here you can feel the belief in American's blood.
Belief that they are free. 
As they wouldn't fear what cannot be said because of the prohibition from the Authority.
As they have the First **Condiment** protecting them.
Belief that they can make a difference.
I feel this most when talk to my supervisor Lixia. 
She holds a firm belief that what we are working on can change the world.

Yet, belief happens to be what I don't have.
Stopped believing for a long time.
Lost faith in China, in my hometown, in everything but me.
I guess that's why I feel that I am homeless.
And feel the word _homeward_ is just a null pointer for me.

Should I have anything to do besides all the internship and application and GRE test. Let's hope I can find that belief and make a home at US.
