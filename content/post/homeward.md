While I was in Los Angeles, I found a song called _Homeward_, composed by Marcus Warner. I was in love with _Homeward_ at the first sight. It is known that you can concatenate 'back' or 'fore' with 'ward' to show a direction. That said, 'homeward' can be interpreted as 'direction home'. Almost instantly that reminds me of my home.

But the question is, where is it? 

I cannot deny that my home is in China, at least that is what I said whenever front desk in Hedrick Hall wants to verify my home address. And for what's worth, I might have to bear with this identity for another decade to get on a flight or simply get drunk. Cannot throw it away. But when thinking carefully, that isn't really my identity.

When I can still remember my first novel I read: _Doomsday Book_.
	Culture 
		History
		Food 
		Government

Taizhou is not my home too.
	Changes are good.
	Bad economy

Trying to find a home in US, failed.
	Understand what freedom is.
	Trying to date girls here.

In the end, homeward may be just a null pointer that can be used but cannot be dereference.
