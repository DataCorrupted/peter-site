While I was in Los Angeles, I found a song called _Homeward_, composed by Marcus Warner. 
I was in love with [_Homeward_](https://marcuswarnermusic.bandcamp.com/track/homeward) at the first sight. 
It is known that you can concatenate 'back' or 'fore' with 'ward' to show a direction. 
That said, 'homeward' can be interpreted as 'direction home'. 
Almost instantly that reminds me of my home.

But the question is, where is it? 

I cannot deny that my home is in China, at least that is what I said whenever front desk in Hedrick Hall wants to verify my home address. 
And for what's worth, I might have to bear with this identity for another decade to get on a flight or simply get drunk. 
Cannot throw it away. But when thinking carefully, that isn't really my identity.

It's not strange that I had a hard time appreciating Chinese culture when the book I read, TV program I watch and even games I play is not from China.
When other kids were reading _Romance of the Three Kingdoms_, my first long novel was actually [_Doomsday Book_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_Book_(novel)) by [Connie Willis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connie_Willis). 
I complained that the names in Chinese stories are hard to remember, yet I managed to finish _Doomsday Book_, where names are generally 4 or 5 Chinese characters long after translation. 
Instead of memorizing how people overrun their government over and over again, I learned what **Black Death** was like in 14th century through _Doomsday Book_. 

_Doomsday Book_ is a good science fiction which won both [_Nebula Award_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebula_Award) and [_Hugo Award_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_Award), yet until 2016 only 23 novels can won both. 
That's how I know [Larry Niven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Niven), by reading through that 23 novels(Except that I have already finished _Doomsday Book_). 
Larry's work [_Ringworld_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ringworld) was so facinating that it pulled me away from _Water Margin_ and, honestly, I never finish _Water Margin_.



	Culture 
		History
		Food 
		Government

Taizhou is not my home too.
	Changes are good.
	Bad economy

Trying to find a home in US, failed.
	Understand what freedom is.
	Trying to date girls here.

In the end, homeward may be just a null pointer that can be used but cannot be dereference.
