While I was in Los Angeles, I found a song called _Homeward_, composed by Marcus Warner. 
I was in love with [_Homeward_](https://marcuswarnermusic.bandcamp.com/track/homeward) at the first sight. 
Even before listening to it, the name _Homeward_ and the picture of the album is breathtaking enough.
It is known that you can concatenate 'back' or 'fore' with 'ward' to show a direction. 
That said, 'homeward' can be interpreted as 'direction home'. 
Almost instantly that reminds me of my home.

But the question is, where is it?

I cannot deny that my home is in China, at least that is what I said whenever front desk in Hedrick Hall wants to verify my home address. 
(Apparently, I forgot my Burin Card somewhere more than once. )
And for what's worth, I might have to bear with this identity for another decade or two to get on board a flight or simply get drunk. 
Cannot throw it away. But when thinking carefully, that isn't really my identity.

Not matter how I claim that I love my government, I can't hide the fact that I was so disappointed that I really don't care anymore. 
Like your ex. 
You can tell tones of her bad habits but you won't, unless someone tells you that she's such a great girl and then you try to save him.
That's what happened when we bumped into a Lyft driver.
We were going to shooting range to learn how to use a pistol.

"You are Chinese!", the driver recognized us.  

"Yeah?", to be honest I was a little bit awkward to be recognized as Chinese, even though I was study in _University of Chinese and Lots of Asians(UCLA)_.  

"You know, you have an amazing government."   

I was instantly amused.
I've seen such stupid words in forms in China thousands of times.
They brag about our government with their arrogance and ignorant yet provides no reason, no proof.
Normally I would think people who say this are brainwashed by Communists and I would ignore whatever they have to say about our government.
Yet it was the first time to hear it from an old white man and there is no way he get brainwashed too.

So I asked, "Why do you think so."  

"Man, your government feeds 1.7 billion people, that's no kidding job."  

"1.4 to be exact, but you are right, that's quite an effort." I agreed. 

"
 But you have to know the price it take to get feed. 
 We lost freedom and we have to stand in line to listen to whatever our government has to say.
 And to fight for freedom many even lost their lives 30 years ago.
"  

"
 Yeah, I know the democracy stuff, but there is no such a system that works for all. 
 Whatever fits the most is the best.
"

He backed off(can't argue democracy with white I suppose), but my interest didn't.
So I kept asking why he thought we have a "great" government.
And he kept talking.
He talked about our super projects like high-speed rail way, the Belt and Road, our investment in Aferica.

"
 These are just projects we did to show off.
 China kept burning money on these with the sole purpose to get into your head.
 Local governments almost went bankrupted with these projects and have a debt that you cannot image.
 Guess who pays the debt at the end of the day?
 And where on earth did you learned that?
", I concluded, with fear that he might also get brainwashed.

Sadly, his knowledge of China all came from a program he watched.
A program that "happen" to be made by out party.
So my fear was true.
Instantly I almost felt responsible to change his thought.

"Did you know that our president just become emperor?" I never shared this with anyone that is not Chinese.
Because this is too shameful.
The fact that our vote is barely useful is embarrassing enough.
Telling people that our congress passed the bill that the president can stay forever with no blackball is no different telling people that my mother just get raped.
(Well, in my defense for such rude words, my "Mom China" did get raped by some money junky.)

"Emperor?! Don't you have a congress or parliament?"
 
"
 Yeah, our congress passed the bill. 
 The president can stay there forever.
 Seriously, our congress is just a birthday party that agrees with whatever the president says.
"

"
 Well, that's a progress.
 Everything has a progress.
"
Can't save him. 
That's what I told myself.

That moment, I know, as long as our Xi the Great is there, there is no coming back for me.
And it's not strange that I had a hard time appreciating Chinese politics and culture.
When other kids were reading _Romance of the Three Kingdoms_, my first long novel was actually [_Doomsday Book_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_Book_(novel)) by [Connie Willis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connie_Willis). 
It is a good science fiction which won both [_Nebula Award_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebula_Award) and [_Hugo Award_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_Award), yet until 2016 only 23 novels can won both. 
That's how I know [Larry Niven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Niven), by reading through that 23 novels(Except that I have already finished _Doomsday Book_). 
Larry's work [_Ringworld_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ringworld) was so fascinating that it pulled me away from _Water Margin_, and honestly, I never finish _Water Margin_. 
I felt suck when I was told Song at last surrendered to the government and get killed so after.

We do learn Chinese, History and Politics in Middle school. 
But I was reading _The Summer of 1787, The Men who Made the Constitution_ by then. 
I have to say that the history and politics education in China is such a failure that it can barely brought anyone's interest. 
After all, the story of how the world's great nations constitution is made is way more funny than the importance of the foundation of our party. 
The educators may forget that human beings memorize stories better than bullet points.
Or they just want to brainwash everyone to follow our party's lead. 
Whichever reason it may be, I am lucky that I have passed that painful time(and got a low score on Politics & History).

If I am such a failure that I cannot blend in my country, where do I belong?
The question I proposed at the very beginning didn't get solved.

The first si-fi TV program I watched was _Fringe_. 
In this series J.J.(Yes, this series was written by [J.J. Abrams](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/j._j._Abrams), the J.J Abrams who also wrote [_Counterpart_](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterpart_(TV_series))) assumed that there is a parallel universe that are almost the same.
(We use _the other xx_ and _our xx_ to distinguish things between two universes.) 
And they are in war.
In the final episode of Season 3, the two universes finally made peace and they are shutting down the portal to each other.
Our Lincoln was in love with the other Olivia so decided to stay in the other side and never came back.
Before the portal was shut down, Lincoln was standing on the other side of the portal and staring at Olivia, and our Olivia asked:

"You sure you are not coming **home**?"

**"Home is where heart is."**, Lincoln replied, short but powerful.

Honestly, that is the most beautiful thing you can ever say to a girl.
And it is also the fanciest sentence that can guide you home.
Because instead of which country you belong to you can answer another question that made more sense(but also harder.)

Then I started to examine where my heart is.

The first answer I canceled out is Shanghai.
The city has many flavors. 
For many people that's a huge up.
But for me, it's mainly bitter and spicy.

My heart was broken by a girl in my first winter in Shanghai.
I have to admit that I was an asshole and I did her wrong.
Yet I was young and naive and still got hurt.
So I spent the next year or two fixing my life.
And while doing that I may broke someone else's hearts too.

Once at time, almost simultaneously, I liked a girl and someone else had crush on me.
And out of all odds, both of them are students in ShanghaiTech.
I was too afraid to choose, too afraid to lose.
What if I am still that asshole?
Sure it didn't ended well.
And for what I know, my reputation was just as bad among their friends. 
So it official that I am an asshole now. :)

Maybe that's part of everyone's life. 
Like I once said, you cannot get what you want and only possess what you don't care.
**And most relationships turn into a set of compromise.**
This was inspired by the _reacher theory_ in _How I Met Your Mother_.
There is always a reacher and a settler, isn't it?

Time flies into 2018 and I am finally ready to start over again.
She hates spicy food just like me. 
Likes dog and Japanese food, treats life with optimization.
Everything I could dreamed of.

So I dated her our.
Well, not a date for her.
I planned for days and everything began to fall apart from the first second.
She didn't see my rose coming and she thought it was just a casual dinner as a friend.
But I send her home anyway even though I got _friended_.
I am not sure how can I describe the night.
At first I wanted it to be a night we both can remember.
Now all I want is to forget it.

At least I admired her honest.
She told me she was onto someone else but because of him they couldn't get together.
She also told me all the details that I don't really want to know as I was busy myself.

She's a _reacher_, me too. 
She don't want to settle, me too.

After 3 years of struggling, the result is simple, I can barely make a home in Shanghai.
Then how about my birthplace, Taizhou?
My train is heading Taizhou as I write.
I like the place, every time I got to introduce her I would do it with pride.
Maybe that's what belonging feels like.

But I couldn't stay for now.
After  all, it's just a small town in the middle of Jiangsu that no one really cares.
No job opportunities, no bread.

The hard truth is, we are the 40th out of 200+ cities in China in terms of economy.
But we have **no high-speed train** and we share an airport with Yangzhou.
Oh, by the way we have no metro even though we are long qualified.
Why? 
I don't know.
Maybe Taizhou would be a good home for me. 
But get packed in this 13-hour long train trip from Beijing I am afraid there is no way home.

Even though my destination is Taizhou, **I am heading nowhere.**
I've been thinking about go immigrant to Uncle Sam since I lost faith in China in high school.
The most critical time has come.
This winter I am going to apply for a grad school and start the immigrant process as I long planned.

Let's hope I find a home there.
