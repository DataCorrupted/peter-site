**Alert: I an not an essay expert, I myself is struggling with essays for grad school as you read. 
However, I am gonna note some common, probably naive problems here that you may learn from.
Something may be helpful to you, and something may be wrong(just that I am not aware of).
You should read it and think it through before you took my advice. 
Refer to more qualified if necessary.**
