# Biography

I'm a research scientist in [Meta](https://about.meta.com/).
I develop compiler optimizations to help improve the performance of Meta's Family of Apps.

I earned my bachelor degreed in [ShanghaiTech University](https://www.shanghaitech.edu.cn/eng/). I was fortunate enough to be the first batch of undergraduates studying in ShanghaiTech.

I got my Ph.D. in [UC Davis](https://www.ucdavis.edu/).
My thesis, [_Greybox Fuzzing and Its Applications_](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/2552c1n9), focuses on fuzzing, compiler testing, and software analysis using large language models.
You can find my papers in my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=feGWM20AAAAJ&hl=en) page.
