# Biography

I am a Ph.D. candidate in UC Davis. My focus now is in [fuzzing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzing). I have a submitted work on how to actively detect integer arithmetic errors using fuzzers. Since I haven't heart from the committee, I couldn't share more details with you.

I have a colorful personal life. 
My interests including archery, dogs and si-fi. I like driving, but manual transmission only. I am also a foodie and a (mediocre) cook, loves [huaiyang cuisine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huaiyang_cuisine) and [fusion cuisine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusion_cuisine). 
~~My gf is still a null pointer so I can't reference her here or this site crashes. XD.~~ My gf is Xue, who is a Ph.D. candidate in Applied Math, I shall cite her once her page is done :)
