# Biography

I am a Ph.D. candidate in UC Davis. My focus now is in Security, software security and fuzzing to be more precise. Now I am interning in [Bytedance](https://bytedance.com/)'s security Lab, Shanghai. I have a submittd work on how to actively detect integer arithmetic errors using fuzzers. Since I haven't heart from the committee, I couldn't share more details with you.

I have limited yet colorful personal life. My interes including archery, dogs and si-fi. My gf is still a null pointer so I can't reference her here. I will be in Shanghai until 29th, Aug.
